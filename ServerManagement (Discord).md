## Server Management


>So basically the problem is the management of the different sections.

```
A normal hirachie would look something like this:

GAMING SECTION
    * TERRARIA
        - ANNOUNCEMENTS
        - EVENTS
        - WHITELIST
        - UPDATES
        - ETC...
    * MINECRAFT
        - LAWS
        - HOW TO JOIN
        - GAME INFOS
        - ETC...
    * HYTALE
        - SERVER
        - MODS
        - HOW TO PLAY
        - WHITELIST
        - ETC...
    * MAYBE FUTURE GAMES
    ...
```

>And there is the problem with discord servers. You only have one hichary-step you can perform. Wich like I said will often lead to crowded and unorganized places:

```
GAMING SECTION
    * TERRARIA
    - ANNOUNCEMENTS
    - EVENTS
    - WHITELIST
    - UPDATES
    - ETC...
    * MINECRAFT
    - LAWS
    - HOW TO JOIN
    - GAME INFOS
    - ETC...
    * HYTALE
    - SERVER
    - MODS
    - HOW TO PLAY
    - WHITELIST
    - ETC...
    * MAYBE FUTURE GAMES
```
